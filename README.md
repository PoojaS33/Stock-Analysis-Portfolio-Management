# Stock-Analysis-Portfolio-Management
We have an investor named Alexandra with the following characteristics: She is a conservative investor and wants to invest the money she saved in her school days received from her millionaire parent. She wants to set up an NGO to support people in Sub-Saharan Africa and expects that her investment should fetch adequate returns to fund this initiative. She doesn't want to get any support from outside for this project and wants to do it with her own funds. Hence, she expects a decent but steady flow of funds from her investments for a long time.
